I am brand spanking new to programming and honestly I dont know what the hell I'm doing. However, I have an idea and I want to run with it. I've tried hiring freelance programmers 
and i've gotten scammed and lost a lot of money. so I need help, and I'll take all the advice/help that I can get...

so, please do not hesitate to point, guide and provide feedback.
